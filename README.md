# HMDA_Project
For this project, I utilized the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) API, I aggregated data on mortgage loan applications in Miami-Dade County. Below, I've detailed my process of cleaning up and exploring the data, as well as creating multiple visualizing for unique trends over time (2007-2017). I also created a simple classification model (Random Forest) to predict whether an application would be approved or not, based on the features in the dataset.

I view this as very much a work in progress and will and more analysis and code comments overtime. I also plan to try other models and well as further tune my existing SGD Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.
